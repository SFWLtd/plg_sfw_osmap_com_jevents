Simple JEvents for OSMap
========================

* Joomla! (http://www.joomla.org) is one of the world's leading CMS platforms.
* OSMap (https://www.alledia.com/extensions/osmap/) is a popular sitemap extension for Joomla!
* JEvents (http://jevents.net/) is an events management platform built on top of Joomla!

This package contains code to integrate events from JEvents into sitemaps generated by OSMap.

The package consists of a Joomla! plugin and instructions for using it.


Installation and Usage
----------------------

Assuming that you already have Joomla!, JEvents and OSMap installed and working, installing this plugin is simple:

1. Use the Joomla! extensions manager to install the plugin.
2. Go to the plugins list and enable it.
3. Ensure that you have a page on your site that uses JEvents' "Site Crawler" menu type.
4. Ensure that this page is included in your site map.

Following the above instructions, you should now be able to go to the site map and see that the events that are listed in the crawler page are now shown in your sitemap.

This plugin does not have any configuration settings. You can, however, configure it to some extent by configuring the crawler page; eg specifying which categories the page should show.
